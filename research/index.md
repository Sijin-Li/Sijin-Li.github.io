## Overview

I'm broadly interested in why the surface of the Earth looks the way it does. This has led me in a number of directions. I try to understand the topographic signature of various erosion processes as well as the topographic outcome of tectonic forcing. I am also interested in how chemical weathering affects morphology, and the evolution of coastal ecosystems. 

You can have a look at my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9iv6l7wAAAAJ&hl=en) page to see a list of my publications, or navigate to the publications page. Below are some recent papers and projects I've been involved in.
