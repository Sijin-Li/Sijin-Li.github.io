  <p class="post-excerpt">I am the Professor of Earth Surface Processes at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/home">University of Edinburgh</a>,

  <p class="post-excerpt">When you put in professorial promotion paperwork at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/home">University of Edinburgh</a> you are actually allowed to name your "personal chair", and I chose the title above since it sounded respectable and I was nervous I wouldn't be promoted. But I now regret not naming my position "Professor of Mudd".</p>

    <p class="post-excerpt">I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California">Riverside</a>, California, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_navel_orange_tree_(Riverside,_California)">famous</a> <a href="https://newsroom.ucr.edu/2602">for</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB812GB812&q=riverside+orange+labels&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDmIiB8-LlAhWYEMAKHTgxA6cQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1280&bih=610">various</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRNb4GcRhoQ">reasons</a>. I then went to Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Tallahassee, and Nashville (<a href="http://nashville.about.com/od/historyandsites/a/NashHistXline2.htm">The Athens of the South</a>) for some degrees. NOAA kindly provided funding for me to stay in Nashville for a year after my PhD. Then I moved to Edinburgh (<a href="http://www.ewht.org.uk/learning/Athens/why-athens-of-the-north">The Athens of the North</a>) in 2007, and as a result my children rhyme the words 'food' with 'good' and think 20°C/68°F is 'too hot'. In 2015 I spent 8 months at the <a href="https://www.geoscienze.unipd.it/">Department of Geosciences, University of Padova</a> on a <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/international-academic-fellowships-2014">Leverhulme International Fellowship</a>. When not working, you can find me complaining on <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonMariusMudd">twitter</a> about the lack of segregated cycle routes in Edinburgh, or <a href="https://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/things-to-do/snorkel-trails/">snorkling</a> with my children in the <a href="https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/united-kingdom/scotland/">North Sea</a>.</p>
