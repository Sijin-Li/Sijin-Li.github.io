  <h2 class="post-title">Vitae</h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">I am from a small city called Yanzhou in Shandong province, China. I had studied as a MSc student in Salzburg, Austria from 2019 to 2020 and my major was Applied Geoinformatics. Currently, I am a PhD student and still work for my degree. </p> 
    <p class="post-excerpt">Football is my favorite sport. I have watched Arsenal's games for about ten years. I really want to go to Highbury and see one game live.</p> 
    <p class="post-excerpt">In addition, I also took some video about my life (some vlog). You could find it in <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/358461602">this website</a> (but it is a Chinese website and all words are Chinese).</p>
