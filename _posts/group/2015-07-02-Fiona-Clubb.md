## Research

  Fiona is using [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) data to look for topographic signatures of geomorhpic process transitions in eroding landscapes. 
  
  You can find out more on her [personal website](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0923330/).

## Publications

  Google Scholar: [Fiona J. Clubb](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LnCvUwwAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Software

  Fiona has written code to detect channel heads using a processed-based strategy, you can find the [Dreich algorith](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:DrEICH_algorithm) on CSDMS. 
 
  She is one of the main developers of the [LSDTopoTools](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/) software package: you can search for his contributions using our [automated software tracking](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html); his contributions are under author = FJC.
