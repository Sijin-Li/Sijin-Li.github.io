Stuart W.D. Grieve

{% include toc.html %}

## Research

Stuart has been trying to quantify hillslope length-relief relasionships to test sediment flux laws and ladslide hazard. Details can be found on his [personal website](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0675405/). 

## Publications

Stuart needs to get a google scholar page!!

## Software

Stuart has been working on quantifying hillslope lengths using new hilltop routing schemes. His [hillslope length code](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:Hilltop_flow_routing) can be found at CSDMS. 

He is one of the main developers of the [LSDTopoTools](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/) software package: you can search for his contributions using our [automated software tracking](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html); his contributions are under author = SWDG.
