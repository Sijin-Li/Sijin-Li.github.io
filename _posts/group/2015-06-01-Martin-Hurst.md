Martin D. Hurst

{% include toc.html %}

## Research

  Martin completed his PhD with the group in 2012. He used [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) data to examine how high resolution topography could reveal changes in erosion rates, including a technoquie that [may allow us to distinguish tectonically active from quiescent landscapes](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6148/868.short). 
  Martin now works are the [British Geological Survey](http://www.bgs.ac.uk/staff/profiles/41289.html).
