## Marsh models

  My collaborators and I have a few different marsh models that incorporate plant growth, carbon sequestration, sediment transport. 
  
  * We have a marsh column model, originally developed for the paper [Mudd et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771409000560) that was used in our [2010 GRL paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2010GL045489) and our [2012 Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11440). The [code is on github](https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/marsh_column_model)
  * Guillaume Goodwin, Fiona Clubb and I (but mainly Guillaume) developed algorithms for detecting marsh surfaces. These are [available in a github repository](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_MarshPlatform). This code has been used in the papers [Goodwin et al. (2018)](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/6/239/2018/) and [Goodwin and Mudd (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00062/full)
