Geochemistry

{% include toc.html %}

## Geochemistry
  
  We have models of geochemical evolution of soil that take into account the path of particles as they are detached from parent material and enter mobile regolith. 
  
  The tools can be found at our [LSDGeochemistry github page](https://github.com/LSDGeochemistry).
  
  * We have a number of python scripts to [reproduce results from various geochemistry papers](https://github.com/LSDGeochemistry/WeatheringModels).
  * We also have an [experimental mixing and weathering model](https://github.com/LSDGeochemistry/LSDMixingModel). Earlier versions of this model have been used in [Yoo and Mudd 2005](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/36/1/35/129993/Discrepancy-between-mineral-residence-time-and); [Gabet and Mudd, 2010](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/37/2/151/519451); Mudd and Yoo[2010](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009JF001591); and [Mudd 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.3923).
