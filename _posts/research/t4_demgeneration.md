## Abstract

  With the development of artificial intelligence techniques for geographical knowledge discovery, simulated terrain generation based on deep-learning algorithms has become one practical way to construct accurate terrain data. However, it is still necessary to discuss whether the simulated topographic data contain the characteristics of specific landforms and can support related geographical studies. Therefore, in this study, a deep learning-based model inspired by previous research is constructed to generate loess landform data. We analyzed the influence of inputting different topographic features on terrain generation and evaluated the similarity between the simulated and reference data. The results show that the deep learning-based model can generate simulated topographic data that include similar elevation and slope probability distributions to the reference data of the loess landform. In addition, the generated results may have inaccurate terrain details, which can be regarded as noise in some cases. This indicates that the selection of input features should be carefully considered. Finally, the simulated data can subsequently support landform and terrain research, especially with intelligence algorithms that require large sets of topographic data.
